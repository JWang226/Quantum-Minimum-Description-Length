# Free Entropy & Quantum Minimum Description Length — Wiki Index

> **Project:** "Free entropy and quantum minimum description length"
> **Authors:** Patrick Hayden, Alexander Maloney, Jinzhao Wang, Yuxiang Yang
> **Last updated:** 2026-10-04

The website has five main tabs: **Home**, **Proof**, **Verification**,
**Background**, and **Papers**. Section tabs and the collapsible sidebar refine
each group. Current theorem arguments are under Proof; historical arguments
and additional paper-level claims are under Background.

**[[intro|Start here]]** -- overview of the project, main result, and how to navigate.

**[[correspondence|Paper ↔ Lean]]** -- manuscript labels, proof guides, exact Lean
statements and coverage notes for the Article and Letter.

**[[proof-structure|Current proof structure]]** -- how representation theory, finite cloning bounds,
physical compression and the quantitative converse fit together.

**[[formalization|Lean formalization and reproduction]]** -- checked scope and commands
for Lean, Comparator and Nanoda.

## Current Article results

Theorem numbers below refer to the bundled Article. The current [[Letter]]
states its compression results as labeled equations and its double-scaling
bridge as a remark; [[Notes]] retains historical numbering. Always qualify
shared equation labels by their source document.

| Result | Article label | Formal role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [[results/achievability|Theorem 1: achievability]] | `thm:qmdl`, `thm:achievability` | Exact memory constant and uniform $O(\log n/\sqrt n)$ error. |
| [[results/converse|Theorem 1: converse]] | `thm:qmdl`, `thm:converse` | Haar-average lower bound for arbitrary physical codes. |
| [[results/cloning-fidelity|Theorem 2: cloning accuracy]] | `thm:main` | Finite trace-distance bounds for the original Choi channels. |

## Supporting propositions

| Result | Article label | Role |

[[results/lemmas/principal-angles|Principal angles]] and
[[results/lemmas/davis-kahan|Davis–Kahan perturbation theory]] are retained as
background to the older fidelity-based presentation. The current finite
trace-distance route is described in [[proof-structure]].

## Proof reading route

4. Follow [[results/converse|the spectral-gap and Haar-average converse]].
5. Use [[formalization|the verification guide]] to check the exact formal statements.
