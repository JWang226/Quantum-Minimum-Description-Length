# Wiki Schema & Maintenance Instructions

This is a **Karpathy-style LLM-maintained wiki** for the project "Free Entropy and Quantum Minimum Description Length" by Hayden, Maloney, Wang, and Yang.

## Purpose

Help the authors and collaborators understand all technical details of the papers. The wiki should be consultable for any concept, result, or proof technique used in the project.

## Source Files

The `manuscript/article.tex` and `manuscript/letter.tex` are the current author-supplied manuscripts. They share `free.bib`; `compression.pdf` is the Letter's figure. The Article snapshot is the source checked by the Lean formalization. Historical Notes source snapshots may remain in the ignored `sources/` directory. Preserve the supplied source bytes; replacing a snapshot requires an explicit user request for the new manuscript version.

For the current Article, Theorem 1 is optimal known-spectrum memory (`thm:qmdl`) and Theorem 2 is finite cloning accuracy (`thm:main`). Use these labels rather than carrying over numbering from older wiki pages. Follow `docs/proof-structure.md`, the actual Lean endpoints, and `metadata/natural-language-map.json` when describing the current formal proof; broader Letter/Notes material is not automatically formalized.

- `manuscript/letter.tex` — Current PRL letter: "Free entropy and quantum minimum description length" (physical free entropy and its QMDL interpretation)
- `manuscript/article.tex` — Current full paper: "Quantum minimum description of density matrices" (companion with full proofs)
- `sources/Free.tex` — Extended working notes with full proofs + unitary/observable programming
- `manuscript/free.bib` — Current shared bibliography
- `manuscript/compression.pdf` — Current Letter's compression figure

## Working Directory

Use the current checkout of `JWang226/Quantum-Minimum-Description-Length`. This git repository auto-deploys to GitHub Pages via `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`. **After making authorized wiki edits, commit and push to update the live site.**

The Obsidian vault root is `docs/` inside this directory.

## Maintenance Workflow

### Lean Performance Changes
Measure the affected file before changing elaboration tactics. Prefer precise
Mathlib tactic-provider imports when an umbrella import dominates the profile;
verify every downstream consumer with `lake build All`. Keep project-only cold
builds separate from warm single-file profiles, and report measured CPU separately
from elapsed module timings. Shared-machine timings do not establish a causal
whole-project speedup. Preserve source-bound audit records when cleanup changes
the proof-source fingerprint; use fresh checks and an explicit reviewed bridge
instead of relabeling old evidence.

### After Any Wiki Edits
When the user asks to commit, commit all changes and push to `origin main`. The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically rebuild and deploy the live site at https://jwang226.github.io/Quantum-Minimum-Description-Length/.

### On Ingest (new/updated source)
1. Diff against the previous manuscript snapshot in `manuscript/` (or a historical copy in `sources/`)
2. Update or create pages for every new/changed definition, result, concept
3. Update cross-references (`## Dependencies`, `## Used By`)
4. Update `notation.md` for any new symbols
5. Update `index.md`
6. Append to `log.md`

### On Query
1. Search relevant wiki pages
2. Synthesize answer with `[[links]]` to wiki pages
3. If the answer reveals a gap, create a new page or update existing ones

### On Lint
1. Check for broken `[[links]]`
2. Check for results missing `## Dependencies` or `## Used By`
3. Check for orphaned pages (not linked from anywhere)
4. Check for stale content (source has changed but wiki page hasn't)
5. Verify `notation.md` is complete

## Conventions

- Use `[[wikilinks]]` (Obsidian-style) for internal cross-references
- LaTeX math: use `$...$` for inline, `$$...$$` for display
- Eigenvalues of $\rho$: always $p_1 > p_2 > \cdots > p_r > 0$ (or $x_1 > \cdots > x_r > 0$ in article.tex)
- Partitions/Young diagrams: $\lambda = (\lambda_1 \ge \lambda_2 \ge \cdots \ge \lambda_d)$
- The three papers are referred to as **Letter**, **Article**, and **Notes**
