## 2026-04-09 — Content revisions: merges, new pages, corrections

### New pages
- `concepts/kolmogorov-complexity.md` — classical Kolmogorov complexity, QKC (Berthiaume/Gacs/Mueller), connection to QMDL as quantum MDL
- `concepts/free-probability-and-entropy.md` — combined intro to free probability, free entropy, and free entropy dimension (replaces separate intro pages)

### Merges
- Merged `free-probability-basics.md` + `free-entropy-intro.md` + free entropy dimension content → `free-probability-and-entropy.md`
- Merged `schur-weyl-duality.md` + `schur-transform.md` → `schur-weyl-duality.md`
- Merged `programming-extensions.md` + `free-entropy-conjecture.md` → `free-entropy-conjecture.md`

### Corrections
- `kumars-theorem.md` — corrected: Kumar shows multiplicity ≥ 1 for general Weyl group elements, not always = 1. The PRV component (multiplicity exactly 1) corresponds to the longest Weyl group element $w_0$.
- `prv-component.md` — updated to be consistent with Kumar revision
- `error-scaling.md` — revised expected optimal scaling from $1/n$ to $1/\sqrt{n}$, matching YCH qubit case

## 2026-09-30 — Lean proof artifacts and reproduction

- Added the formalization of the bundled manuscript's Theorems 1 and 2, with
  pinned dependencies, axiom audit, Comparator challenges, and Nanoda reproducer.
- Added a wiki link to the authoritative repository instructions and status.
- Kept existing mathematical wiki pages and their source numbering unchanged;
  manuscript labels identify the formalization's targets.
- Kept repository-oriented proof documentation out of the generated wiki, where
  its relative links to Lean files would not resolve.

## 2026-10-01 — Reconcile the wiki with the current proof structure

- Reindexed the current Article: Theorem 1 is optimal known-spectrum memory;
  Theorem 2 is finite cloning accuracy. Source labels distinguish these from
  historical Letter/Notes numbering.
- Added a rendered dependency diagram and a Lean module reading map, and
  revised the introduction, Article overview, result index and navigation.
- Replaced the older fidelity/truncation and good-sector converse accounts
  with direct trace deficits, uniform mean depth, physical typical-sector
  comparison, exact padded-target dimensions and the Haar-orbit memory bound.
- Corrected supported gaps, signed differences, typical-set padding, memory
  conventions, representation-state weights and physical sector probabilities.
- Linked the Cartan, original Choi and Petz certificates and distinguished
  their proved scope from general channel claims and genuine extensions.
- Updated the verification guide and source links. Manuscript and Lean proof
  sources are unchanged; this update changes their wiki explanations.

## 2026-10-01 — Current Article and Letter source reconciliation

- Compared the author-supplied `article.tex` and `letter.tex` with the public
  sources. The Article is byte-identical to the checked manuscript; added the
  current Letter and its required `compression.pdf` without changing either
  manuscript or any Lean theorem source.
- Replaced stale Letter definitions and interpretations throughout the wiki:
  exact ambient tube-volume ratio, resolution $n^{-1}$, omitted coincident
  eigenvalue terms, Hilbert–Schmidt normalization, explicit offsets and
  conditional double-scaling assumptions.
- Distinguished current Letter equations from Article theorem numbering and
  historical Notes, and separated general-multiplicity geometric formulas
  from the open repeated-positive-spectrum compression problem.
- Added a hash-bound companion source map and release/metadata validation.
  The Article's compression formulas retain their checked Lean correspondence;
  Letter volume and bridge claims are explicitly not separately formalized.

## 2026-10-05 — Retrospective statement and manuscript-coverage audit

- Added source-first agent reviews of the four primary theorem endpoints, with
  expanded hypothesis tables, definition scope and explicit premise discharge.
- Added a separate adversarial review, a 407-item Article inventory and a source
  graph with 75 nodes and 137 dependency use sites. Clarified compound-statement
  grouping, external-result provenance and limits of mathematical coverage.
- Compiled seven anonymous Lean applications, including the physical-state
  formulation of Theorem 2, and recorded compiled binders and permitted axioms.
- Added reproducible audit checks, rejection controls and a website build hook
  binding the reports to the reviewed sources. Linked the audit from the
  correspondence page, verification section and README.

## 2026-10-06 — Dead-code sweep and measured elaboration cleanup

- Removed one unused private weight-equality lemma, then completed the requested
  before test, measured cleanup and second test using the pinned elaboration
  skills. Both project-only cold builds compiled all 270 proof modules and four
  entry/facade modules with stable sources and warm pinned dependency artifacts.
- Narrowed the sole `Mathlib.Tactic` umbrella import in `GTDeterminant` to its
  Linarith and Positivity providers. Three serial profiles per variant observed
  GT median wall time 39.11s→11.24s and total CPU 12.45s→6.11s. No retained source
  statement text or proof body changed; no heartbeat limits or suppressions grew.
- Published detailed before/after reports, raw evidence, source identities and
  reproducible benchmark/profile commands. Full-build wall time fell 4.15%,
  but total CPU rose 5.83%; shared load prevents a causal whole-project speedup
  claim. Warning counts remained 131. Five baseline and nine after hotspots were
  profiled separately.
- Preserved the strict compiled comparison's 15 raw syntactic differences.
  Two exact closed foundation instance pairs passed literal kernel `Eq.refl`
  checks; a false equality was rejected. The separately qualified comparison has
  zero residual type/data changes across 4,526 retained declarations, and all
  four final theorem signatures match raw. The fresh scratch reproducer and
  its 15 guard controls passed.
- Refreshed the actual 2,499-public-declaration axiom audit, seven anonymous
  statement applications, compiled catalog and correspondence checks. All three
  fresh Comparator comparisons/replays and rebuilt pinned Nanoda checks passed,
  including Nanoda's seven rejection/acceptance control groups. These local runs
  were unsandboxed; no new human or source-first manuscript review is asserted.
- Preserved historical verification bytes and dates, added a bounded cleanup
  review bridge, refreshed current source-bound evidence, and linked the new
  elaboration guide in the README and Verification navigation. Manuscript bytes
  and dependency pins remain unchanged.

## 2026-10-06 — v0.1.0-rc1 preparation

- Prepared candidate citation metadata, scope notes and frozen-tag/source-archive
  reproducer commands. The release candidate is not yet published; licensing and
  adapted-code attribution remain pending.
- Recorded the successful hosted clean-source reproduction at `5203e01`
  separately from local unsandboxed checks and later packaging edits. Human
  correspondence review and Linux/Landrun Comparator checking remain pending.
- Clarified that named historical benchmark/checker evidence retains local
  execution paths, while private correspondence, credentials, caches and
  machine-specific build products are excluded from the source package.

## 2026-10-06 — v0.1.0-rc1 license and release finalization

- Applied the maintainer-confirmed Apache-2.0 software grant and the copyright
  credit "Jinzhao Wang and contributors," including authority for the four
  prior Cloning source adaptations. Recorded the exact source snapshot in
  NOTICE and retained manuscript and third-party rights and notices.
- Updated citation, release guide and frozen-tag/archive reproducer commands.
  Human correspondence review and Linux/Landrun checking remain pending.
- Preserved the earlier hosted record and recorded the successful clean-source
  CI run at `7d5cf57` separately. Licensing and release metadata changes leave
  all production Lean sources and supplied manuscript bytes unchanged.

## 2026-10-06 — Published release wiki follow-up

- Linked the public v0.1.0-rc1 release and its frozen reproducer from the wiki
  overview. Updated software credit and Apache-2.0 status in the scope page.
- Recorded the successful CI run for the exact release tag at `4ce4384`,
  separately from earlier local and hosted evidence. Human correspondence
  review and Linux/Landrun checking remain pending.
- Corrected stale license-pending and local-clean-build wording in the current
  human-readable scope document. The release tag and source archive are frozen;
  these documentation updates describe current status on main.

## 2026-10-08 — Comparator specification clarification

- Checked supplied statement-review comments against the current manuscript,
  endpoints, physical-state bridge and pinned Comparator implementation.
  Clarified that imported constants are compared, while agreement after a
  shared specification change does not independently certify manuscript meaning.
- Linked the existing compiled physical-state application and its recorded
  incremental check. Described the correctly oriented linear isometry needed
  for a stronger independent representation/projector interface.
- Added a separate verification page and challenge documentation. Original
  audit records, proof sources, manuscript bytes and the frozen release are
  unchanged; this clarification is not a new human review or kernel run.
